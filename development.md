# Why I Chose AWS Amplify for Hosting My Angular Project

When deciding on a hosting platform for my Angular project, I chose **AWS Amplify** because it provides a modern, developer-friendly, and scalable solution for deploying and managing web applications. Below are the key reasons behind this choice:

## 1. Easy Deployment and Hosting
Amplify offers a **streamlined deployment process**. By connecting my GitHub repository (or any supported source control), Amplify automatically builds, deploys, and hosts my Angular project every time I push changes. This eliminates the need to manually configure CI/CD pipelines.

## 2. Built-in CI/CD Support
With Amplify, I get **continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)** out of the box. Each commit triggers a new build and deployment, ensuring my project is always up-to-date without manual intervention.

## 3. Scalability
Amplify is powered by AWS infrastructure, meaning it can easily scale with traffic demands. Whether I’m hosting a personal project or an application with thousands of users, Amplify handles scaling automatically.

## 4. Global Content Delivery
Amplify uses the **AWS CloudFront CDN** for delivering content. This ensures that my Angular app loads quickly for users around the world by serving files from the nearest edge location.

## 5. Secure and Managed Hosting
Amplify comes with **free HTTPS and SSL certificates**, ensuring secure connections by default. I don’t need to manually handle SSL setup or certificate renewals.

## 6. Backend Integration (Optional)
Amplify isn’t just hosting — it also makes it easy to connect my frontend Angular app to various AWS services (like authentication with Cognito, APIs with API Gateway/Lambda, and storage with S3). Even though I started with just hosting, this gives me flexibility to expand in the future.

## 7. Cost-Effective
For small projects, Amplify offers a **free tier**, and beyond that, it charges based on usage. This makes it affordable compared to managing my own servers or configuring multiple AWS services separately.

### Conclusion
I chose AWS Amplify because it simplifies the entire lifecycle of my Angular application — from **deployment and hosting** to **scalability and security**. It allowed me to focus more on building features rather than spending time managing infrastructure.
